Population Table for the United States, 1960
This data set contains population data from the year 1960 in the United States. I am a bit confused because there is a "total" value for each age,
but that is not equal to the sum of males and females. I used the sum of the 2 because I believed that that may give me more consitency.
http://api.population.io/1.0/population/1960/United%20States/?format=json
The import was done with the line $ sudo mongoimport -d macaroni --drop --file=pop.json --jsonArray
--jsonArray is necessary because our json file was stored as an array and attempting to import the file without this gave the error
Failed: error unmarshaling bytes on document #0: JSON decoder out of sync - data changing underfoot?
